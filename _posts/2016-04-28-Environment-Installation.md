# Environment Installation

Installing a robust environment can be tricky and painful. A data science without his environment is just like a musician without his instrument. We tried several softwares, programming language etc. We found **jupyter notebook** with proper kernels (python2, python3, pyspark) to be one of the best answer for our needs. 

In this tutorial we will show how to properly your jupyter environment with both a python2 and a python3 version. 

### Step 1 : installing python2 and python3

Installing python is quite straight forward, we highly recommend to use **brew** to install the various librairies. If you do not have Homebrew you can easily get it via the terminal command : 

```shell
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
```
